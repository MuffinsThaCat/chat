## Status Web Chat

[Click here to access status-web](https://status-im.github.io/chat/build/). note that no plugins are required, just a compatible browser. Currently recommended are Chrome and
Firefox.

**Note: This is a proof of concept, and an alpha version. There will be bugs. If you you're looking for something more stable try the [status desktop app](https://status.im/get_desktop/).**

known issues:
- Only tested in CHrome & Firefox. Reportedly works on android mobile browsers but not on ios (to be confirmed). In theory it should work on any webrtc enabled browser.
- Direct chats and chat history is currently disabled.

what you can do:
- Join other status channels, this bridges with devp2p network.
- see who is online in the channel (applicable to other status-web users)
- see who is typing in the channel (applicable to other status-web users)
- see previews for images, spotify (e.g `spotify:track:0vnfZAVW1Suiet6wtUMdg9`)
- code formatting(e.g ``js` var a = 3;``)
- upload files
- emojis support

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
